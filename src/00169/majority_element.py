    Leetcode Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/

    This function finds the majority element in the input list `nums`. The majority element
    is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times, where n is the size of the list.

    The implementation uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which identifies the majority
    element in linear time and constant space.

    Time Complexity: O(n)
        - The list is traversed once, making the time complexity linear, where n is the number
          of elements in the list.

    Space Complexity: O(1)
        - The function uses a constant amount of additional space.
