Leetcode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of Leetcode problem solutions! I’m Sujinder Pothula, and I have created this repository to stay in touch with the basics of coding and problem-solving, as well as to provide solutions to the larger community of developers.

About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to various Leetcode problems, which I solve on a regular basis. The main goals of this repository are:

Continuous Learning: To keep my problem-solving skills sharp and stay updated with fundamental algorithms and data structures.
Community Contribution: To share my solutions with the community, helping others who are preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

Structure of the Repository
Each problem solution is stored in its own directory under the src folder. The directory is named after the Leetcode problem number, and contains two files:

    1. a solution file containing the source code.
    2. a test file containing the corresponding unit tests using pytest.

Here’s an example structure for problem number 122:
src/
├── 00122/
│ ├── max_profit_ii.py
│ └── max_profit_ii_test.py
...

How to Use This Repository
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git

Navigate to a Problem Directory: Change directory to the problem you are interested in:
cd src/00122

Run the Tests: Use pytest to run the tests for the solution:
pytest solution_test.py

Contributing
